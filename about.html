        Dungeon Quest has many different mechanics, while in the dungeon you
        have a chance for a boss named "Gregg" to spawn in and if you defeat him
        you get rewarded with extra loot and random amount of materials ranging
        from 1-3. You can use these materials in the lobby to craft new weapons
        which are stronger than the weapons you drop from the dungeon. As you
        progress through all the dungeons they get exponentially more difficult
        to complete giving the player more of a challenge, You can also trade
        other players to get loot for your current level. Their are also
        cosmetics that you can grind for by doing quests, You can get cosmetic
        Armors, Weapons, Enchants, Auras and Titles.
